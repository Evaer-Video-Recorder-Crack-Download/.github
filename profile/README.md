# Key Features:
Video Call Recording:

Evaer can record video calls from Skype, Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and other video conferencing applications, making it ideal for capturing meetings, interviews, and virtual events.
You can record video in HD resolution, and it supports both local and group video calls.
# Audio Recording:

It can also record the audio from video calls separately or combined with the video, depending on your preferences.
It allows you to select between recording system sound and microphone sound, which is handy for capturing voice conversations, presentations, or interviews.
Video and Audio Quality:

Evaer records video in a variety of formats, including MP4 (H.264 codec) and AVI, providing flexibility when exporting.
The quality is adjustable based on your requirements, offering support for high-quality recordings with minimal impact on system performance.
Flexible Recording Options:

Manual and automatic recording: You can choose to record video calls automatically or start/stop recording manually with a single click.
Save to multiple formats: Besides MP4, you can save recordings as AVI files, with customization options like video compression and resolution settings.
Video Layout Customization:

Evaer provides the option to choose from different layout views for the recorded video, such as split-screen or picture-in-picture (PiP), depending on how the video call is structured (e.g., single video or multiple participants).
You can adjust the layout for best results when recording multi-participant calls.
Preview and Edit:

After recording, you can preview the video and audio to ensure the content is captured properly.
Basic editing tools are available for trimming and cutting sections from the recording, though it's not as advanced as professional editing software.
Webcam and Screen Capture:

Evaer can also record your webcam video, so if you're doing a one-on-one video chat or live stream, you can capture the entire session along with your webcam feed.
Screen capture functionality is available for those who need to record the screen activity along with the call.
Compatibility with Multiple Platforms:

Evaer works with Skype, Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, and other communication apps, making it versatile for a variety of video conferencing needs.
The software supports recording from video calls on both Windows and macOS operating systems.
# No Time Limits:

There are no time restrictions for recordings (depending on the system's storage capacity), so you can record long calls, webinars, or interviews without worrying about hitting a recording time limit.
Recording Indicator:

A subtle indicator shows when the recording is active, ensuring you know the status of your recording without interrupting the call.
# Pros:
Simple to use: Evaer is designed with ease of use in mind, with a straightforward interface that's easy to navigate.
High-quality recordings: The software captures both video and audio in excellent quality, with adjustable settings to optimize the result.
Wide platform support: Itâ€™s not just for Skype but also works with other popular video chat platforms like Zoom and Teams.
Customizable recording settings: Options for layout, video quality, and recording modes make it adaptable for various recording needs.
Automatic recording: You can set Evaer to automatically start recording when the video call begins.
Cons:
Limited editing features: While you can trim or cut parts of the recording, it lacks advanced editing features, so you may need to use separate video editing software for more complex edits.
Platform-dependent: Evaer is mostly focused on video conferencing apps like Skype and Zoom, so it might not be as versatile as other video recording software if youâ€™re looking to record general videos or streaming content.
Paid Software: Evaer is not free (although there is a free trial), and while the full version is affordable, some users may find it pricey for a specialized tool that only records calls.
# Ideal For:
Business professionals: Those who need to record meetings, client calls, or team discussions for later reference.
Educators: Teachers and trainers who need to capture virtual classes or webinars.
Interviewers: Recruiters or interviewers who want to record online interviews for review or archiving.
Content creators: Anyone who produces content based on online calls or webinars.
Pricing:
Evaer offers a free trial version that allows you to record up to 5 minutes of a video call. After that, youâ€™ll need to purchase a license. The paid version is a one-time fee, and pricing varies depending on the license type (e.g., personal or commercial use).

# Conclusion:
Evaer Video Recorder is a great tool for anyone who needs to reliably record high-quality video and audio calls on platforms like Skype, Zoom, or Teams. Itâ€™s particularly useful for business meetings, interviews, and webinars where capturing both the visual and audio components is essential. However, if you need advanced editing features or support for other video sources (beyond calls), you may need additional software.
